# ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp

Coursework for the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp. Each module is a self-contained project
in its own numbered folder.

## Module 1 — City Journal

A personal place journal for a city I just moved to. It is **memory, not
discovery**: it remembers places I have been or want to go, and lets me find them
again when I only half-remember them — *"where was that coffee shop with the good
wifi?"*

It is deliberately not a recommender, not a "what should I do today" tool, and
not a neighborhood guide.

### Features

1. **Capture a place in one line.** Name, neighborhood, free-text note, tags, and
   an optional rating — low enough friction to log a spot while still standing
   outside it.
2. **Find it again when I only half-remember it.** Typo-tolerant ranked search
   across name, note, tags, and neighborhood, which never comes back empty: below
   the confidence threshold it offers the closest 3 as weak matches.
3. **Want-to-go → been-there loop.** Every place is `wishlist` or `visited`.
   `todo` shows what I still owe the city; `visit` flips a place over and takes
   the note and rating while the memory is fresh.
4. **Nudges and coverage.** `surprise` picks somewhere to go, favoring the
   never-visited and long-neglected. `stats` shows how much of the city I have
   actually touched.

### Stack

Python 3.13 + Django 6.1 with SQLite, managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
The interface is a CLI built from Django management commands
(`uv run python manage.py add`, `find`, `todo`, `visit`, `surprise`, `stats`),
with the stock Django admin as an optional web window onto the same data. Fully
offline — no API keys, no network calls, no geocoding.

### Documents

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [`module1/_docs/plan.md`](module1/_docs/plan.md) | Scope: the data model, the commands, and what is explicitly out |
| [`module1/_docs/tasks.md`](module1/_docs/tasks.md) | The ten-task backlog, mirrored as issues [#1–#10](https://github.com/elugardo/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/issues) |
| [`module1/_docs/process.md`](module1/_docs/process.md) | How work is picked up, branched, committed, and closed |
| [`module1/_docs/testing-guidelines.md`](module1/_docs/testing-guidelines.md) | Testing conventions |
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Commands and rules for coding agents working in this repo |

### Status

Scaffolded and planned; the commands are not built yet. Setup and usage
instructions land with issue
[#10](https://github.com/elugardo/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/issues/10) in
`module1/README.md`. Until then, `AGENTS.md` has the commands needed to run the
project.
